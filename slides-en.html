        A website is basically a collection of web pages or *HTML documents*, that closely match a file folder structure.

        #Accessing websites and web pages

        When we want to view a specific page on a website, we provide a *URL* to the browser.

        ```xml
        https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/about/
        ```

        The browser uses the URL to determine *how* and *where* to find the files that we're interested in. For example, the URL above would take us to the `About` page on the Canada Learning Code website.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #More about URLs

        URLs typically contain the following pieces:

        - `protocol` - This tells the browser *how* to find the file.
        - `domain` - This is the name of the website itself. It tells the browser *generally* where the file can be found (kind of like a home address).
        - `path` - This tells the browser *specifically* where the file can be found. If the `domain` is the home address, the `path` is the name of the person we're looking for, and which room they're in!

        ```xml
        <protocol>://<domain>/<path>/
        ```

        ```xml
        https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/about/

        #A Basic Web Page: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

        ##HTML
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a _markup_ language used to define the content.

        <p class="example">I'm just a paragraph.</p>

        ##CSS
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a _style sheet_ language used to create the presentation and look of a site.

        <p class="example css">I'm a paragraph with <span>style</span>.</p>

        ##JavaScript
        JavaScript is a _programming_ language used to define the behavior and add functionality to a website.

        <p class="example">I'm a paragraph with a <code>button</code> that can be clicked: <button type="button" onclick="alert('Clicked!');">Try it!</button></p>

        #Web Browsers

        The main functionality of the [browser](https://browsehappy.com/?locale=en) is to present a *web resource* in the browser window.

        Choose a modern web browser, like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/), that supports current web standards and includes dev tools for a better experience.

        You also can view the source of *any* web page:

        1. Right-click / two-finger tap anywhere on the browser
        2. Select **View Page Source**

        That's HTML!

        #Developer Tools

        Most modern web browsers include developer tools. These tools allows you to *inspect* any web page, making it easier to test & debug code.

        Today we'll be using the Chrome browser. The dev tools can be accessed in a couple ways:

        - Option 1: right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**
        - Option 2:
          - PC: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>
          - Mac: <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>

        * Used to write and edit code
        * Default editors (Notepad / TextEdit) don't include many features
        * Paid & free options include features/plugins for improved workflow
        * Some great options:
          - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
          - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (untimed free trial)
          - [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
          - [Brackets](http://brackets.io)

        **[Atom](https://atom.io/)** is totally free and is the editor we'll be using today.

        Inside of the folder you downloaded today, there are many folders that contain different files.

        ```
        llc-html-css-multi-page-site-master
          |-- framework // Contains files needed for slide presentation. Do not edit!
          |-- project // Contains the exercise files for this workshop. (images, CSS & HTML files)
          |-- slides.html // This is the file you are viewing right now!
        ```

        Open the `project` folder in the text editor to edit your project.
        Go to **File** > ** Add Project Folder**. A popup will appear.

        ![Atom editor with File menu open on Mac. Add Project Folder option is highlighted.](framework/img/workshop/editor-add-project-1.jpg)

        * navigate to the `llc-html-css-multi-page-site-master` folder

        #HTML Syntax

        Just like languages that we speak and write, HTML follows proper "grammar" rules, too. HTML *tags* are written with left & right angled brackets <kbd><</kbd><kbd>></kbd> and the forward slash <kbd>/</kbd>. Get to know these keys!

        ![Keyboard with left and right arrow and forward slash keys highlighted](framework/img/workshop/keyboard-html.png)<!-- .element: width="75%" -->

        #HTML Syntax

        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash <kbd>/</kbd>.

        ```html
        <tag> <-- opening tag --- closing tag --> </tag>
        ```

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser.
        ```html
        <h1>This tag describes a heading</h1>
        <p>This tag is for paragraphs.</p>
        ```

        ---
        ##Pro tip!
        HTML *tags* are also often referred to as "elements". You will see these words used synonymously throughout this course.

        #Writing HTML

        To ensure that your tags are closed properly and to help reduce errors, write both the opening and closing tags *first*.

        Then move the cursor between the tags to add the text content.

        When HTML Tags are nested, it creates a family tree-like structure of nodes that are ancestors, parents, children, siblings, etc.

        ```html
        <parent>
          <child></child>
        </parent>

        * hiding code for later use
        * leaving notes
        * organizing the document

        The syntax for comments start with `<!--` and ends with `-->`.

        To create an HTML page, name the file with an `.html` extension.

        1. Use lowercase letters.
          * `about.html` instead of `About.html` or `ABOUT.html`
        2. Avoid <span aria-label="spaces">s p a c e s</span> or symbols. Use underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`).
          * Note that [dashes are better for SEO](http://searchengineland.com/9-seo-quirks-you-should-be-aware-of-146465) (search engine optimization).
          * `business-hours.html` instead of `business hours.html`
          * The browser will interpret spaces as `business%20hours.html`

        #Class Exercise: Create HTML pages

        Let's create HTML files for the **About** and **Contact** pages.  Leave the file itself blank. Content will be added in a later exercise.

        `index.html` already exists, so create `about.html` and `contact.html`.  Make sure to save these pages into the `project` folder.

        In the editor:

        1. File > New file
        2. File > Save

        Your directory will now look like this:

          |-- examples // folder

        ##Pro tip!

        It's best to write as much HTML & content as possible *before* adding CSS to ensure that the proper, [semantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML) HTML elements are being used.

        Check out the [HTML elements reference on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for more details on each HTML element.

        #Paths

        We already know that websites are made up of multiple pages (`.html` files), and that each page can contain different types of content.

        Some of that content lives directly within the page itself (ie. the text), and some of it may live elsewhere (eg. in the images folder, on other websites, etc.).

        When we want to display some content that lives *outside* of the current page, we have to tell the browser where to find it. This information is called a `path`.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Types of Paths

        Paths allow the browser to find, retrieve, and display external resources such as images, CSS/JS files, and even other pages.

        There are two different types of paths:

        * `Relative` - These tell the browser how to get from the current page to the external resource.
        * `Absolute` - These tell the browser *exactly* where the external resource can be found online.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide project" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Relative Paths

        **We use relative paths when we're trying to make a connection between two resources within our own website.**

        Relative paths start from the location of the current page, and tell the browser which folders should be looked in to find the external resource.

        ```xml
        images/backgrounds/dark/dark-background-1.jpg
        ```

        We can think of relative paths like directions.

        We'll be using relative paths to connect the pages of site our shortly!

        http://website.com/images/image-1.jpg

        // CSS
        https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.css
        ```

        Absolute paths start with a protocol (ie. `http` or `https`), followed by the location of the resource.

        If relative paths are like directions, an absolute path is like a home address.

        #Links & Attributes

        Links are represented by the anchor tag (`<a>`) and an *attribute*.

        Remember, *attributes* follow the syntax `attribute="value"` and are added inside the *opening* tag.

        The `href` attribute provides information about where the link is located.

        ```html
        Visit <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>.
        ```

        This link in the example above uses an **absolute** path. Much like typing a URL into the browser, it's "fully resolved" and starts with `http://`.

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Note**: The clickable text goes in between the opening and closing `<a>` tags.

        The navigation in today's project will link to other HTML pages within the project folder, so we'll be using relative links.

        Understanding how to use relative paths and folder structure is super important for creating websites.

        We'll start by using relative paths to make connections between our HTML files, then move on to pulling in images and external CSS.

          |-- examples (folder)

          |-- about.html
          |-- contact.html
        ```

        Since all of the HTML files are in the same folder, the directions *from* the `index` *to* the `about` file would look like this.

        ```html
        <a href="about.html">About Me</a>
        ```

        Since our images are **not** in the same folder as the HTML files, we have to tell the browser to look in a different location.

        ```html
        <img src="images/background-1.jpg" alt="My cool image">

        #HTML5 Sectioning Tags

        Sometimes, multiple HTML elements need to be grouped together for organization and/or styling.

        Prior to HTML5, the [`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) tag was used for grouping elements.

        `div` is still ok to use, but HTML5 introduced a number of semantic tags that better describe blocks of content for asssistive technology.

        You've already seen two of them in `index.html`: `<header>` and `<footer>`.

        Navigations are often created using an HTML list and links or just with links. To learn more, check out the resources below.

        Today we'll be using only links. Wrap the links `<a>` in a `<nav>` tag to group them as navigation links.

        ```html

          <a href="#">About</a>

        There are a few different image file types for the web:

        - `png` - used for images with transparent or opaque backgrounds
        - `svg` - used for 2D graphics, icons and is scaleable, based on XML and can be used as a image file or in the HTML document
        - `gif` - used for images with minimal colour variation and of course, for animated gifs!

        #Adding images

        Images are an example of a empty element/self-closing tag. It doesn't need a closing tag because it _is_ the content.

        The image tag uses the `src` _attribute_ to tell the browser where to find the actual image file.

        The value of the `src` attribute can be an absolute path:

        ```html
        <img src="http://fillmurray.com/200/300" alt="A portrait of Bill Murray">
        ```

        The `alt` attribute refers to *alternative text*.

        The `alt` text is read by [screen reading software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) used by visually impaired users and also displays if the image is missing.

        Depending on the context, it should be a short description of the image:

        ```
        <img src="images/children-in-park.jpg" alt="A group of children play in the park on a sunny day.">

        Images with empty `alt` text attributes will be skipped over by screen readers.

        It's common practice to create a folder to organize images separate from HTML files. Your `project` folder already contains an `images` folder.

        Use the default `profile.jpg` image provided or use your own and add it to this folder.

        The `<main>` tag can be used to represent the central content of the document. Also, a `role="main"` attribute can be added to help screen readers understand where the main content begins.

        ```html
        <header>
          <!-- content -->

          <nav>
            <!-- content -->
          </nav>
        </header>

        <main role="main">
          <!-- content -->
        </main>

        <footer>
          <!-- content -->
        </footer>
        ```

        It is used only once per page and is needed for the upcoming exercise.

        Add some content to your **About** page to make it look like [this](project/examples/ex3-about.html). You can use your own or use the resources below for placeholder text.

        1. Add `<main role="main"></main>` for the About page content not included in the header or footer.
        1. Inside of `<main>`, add a profile picture using the `<img>` tag.
        1. *After* the profile image, add a couple of paragraphs about you, or use placeholder text (see resources below).
        1. Today's project will include specific styles for a quote, so *after* the paragraphs, add a quote using `<blockquote>`.
        1. Optional: Add a few links within the paragraphs.


        For reference, <!-- .element: class="note" -->[`ex3-about.html`](project/examples/ex3-about.html) can be found in the `examples` folder but look only if you're stuck!

        #Another sectioning tag: `<section>`

        Each sectioning tag that we've looked at so far has a very specific purpose, but what if we need something a bit more *general*?

        Sometimes our pages may include content that isn't described by the `header`, `nav`, `main`, or `footer` tags. Luckily, we can use the `<section>` tag.

        ```html
        <main>

        Now that we're comfortable with the `<img>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` tags, we can make some tweaks to our **Home** page.

        Together we're going to:

        - Add a `<section>` tag with an image inside it.
        - Add a `<main>` tag with a heading and some paragraphs.

        Though CSS and HTML are closely paired, CSS is a different language and has its own syntax rules.

        CSS separates content (i.e. text) from presentation (i.e. text colour) and helps to reduce redundancy.

        Older presentational HTML tags like `<center>` and `<font>` should no longer be used because CSS takes care of presentation and styles.

        #Referencing CSS

        There are several ways to include CSS in an HTML page. Today we'll be using the **external** method which separates the HTML from the CSS.

        The style sheet file (.css file extension) is referenced within the `<head>`.
        <span class="note">Reminder, `<head>` is different from `<header>`!</span>

        Use `<link>` and two attributes, `rel` and `href` to link to the CSS file.

        ```html
        <head>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
        </head>
        ```

        Though it is not required, CSS files are often saved in a separate CSS folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory.<!-- .element: class="note" -->

        Create a new CSS file by selecting **File > New File**.

        Let's use `styles.css` and make sure to save it into the `css` folder.

        Add it to all three HTML files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`)

        #font-family and Web safe fonts

        Using the `font-family` property, it's best practice to list at least two or three font options to provide a fall-back option in case the user doesn't have the fonts installed.

        ```css
        body {
          font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        ```

        Fonts that are considered *web safe* are fonts that are commonly installed on most computers.

        Here's a listing of web safe fonts: [CSS Font Stack](http://cssfontstack.com/).

        For more options beyond web safe fonts, services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) (free) and [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) (free & paid) make it easier to add variety.

        Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their style sheet. As long as the user is connected to the internet, they do not need to have the font installed.

        #Inheritance and Specificity

        One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements. (Remember the family tree?)

        ```html
        <body>
          <h1>My Website</h1><!-- child of body -->
          <p>This is a paragraph.</p><!-- sibling of h1 -->
        </body>
        ```
        ```css
        body {
          color: blue;
        }
        h1 {
          color: black;
        }
        ```
        > what colour do you think the paragraph will be? What about the h1?
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Inheritance and Specificity

        ```css
        body {

        }
        h1 {
          color: black;
        }
        ```
        The children and descendent elements of `body` will inherit most styles (not all CSS properties can be inherited*).

        The `h1` is a more specific selector and will override the inherited styles.

        #Combining selectors

        Sometimes you'll have more than one element that share the same styles.  Target multiple elements by *combining* selectors.

        Instead of this:
        ```css
        h1 {
          /* set font colour to blue */
          color:blue;
        }
        h2 {
          /* set font colour to blue */
          color:blue;
        }
        ```
        Do this! (Note the comma)
        ```css
        h1, h2 {
          /* selects both the h1 and h2 */
          color:blue;
        }
        ```
        This does the same thing as the first example but with fewer lines of code and makes it easier to make changes to both elements.

          /* applies only to the child when nested inside of the parent tag */
        }
        p a {
          /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */
        }
        ```

        **Pro tip!** Just like [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), don't go more than three levels deep.

        ```css
        nav ul li a span {
          /* NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! */
        }
        ```

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Note**: You can skip a level but be mindful of specificity rules. For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it's more specific. It’s better to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed.

        #Class Exercise - Typography

        In the sample project, most of site content uses the same font.
        Add the main font family to the `body` declaration block, to make use of CSS inheritance.

        ```css
        body {
          font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
        }
        ```

        Make the headings a different font to set it apart from the body text. Use a more specific selector to override the inherited style.

        ```css
        h1, h2 {
          font-family: "Nixie One", serif;
        }
        ```

        In the LLC project, both `h1` and `h2` also use uppercase letters and don’t use the default bold styles of headings. You can set that using the properties in the example below.
        ```css
        h1, h2 {
          font-family: "Nixie One", serif;
          font-weight: 300; /* removes default bold styles */
          text-transform: uppercase;
        }
        ```

        #Exercise #4 - Typography (~10-15 minutes)

        These instructions are based on the LLC sample project but feel free to pick your own fonts, sizes, colours and typography styles. (We'll be tackling spacing and layout in the upcoming exercises.)

        1. Add a `color` property to the `body` to override the default black.
        The LLC project uses hex code `#333333` (almost black, gray colour).

        1. Links by default are blue so it doesn't inherit the `color` property in `body`.
          * Use the specific element selector (`a`) to change the colour.
          * Choose a colour different from the body colour.
          * Reference the [CSS colors slide](#colours) (syntax & colour resources).

        1. Use a *descendant selector* to change the `font-size` of the `h1` and `h2` in the `header`. (The LLC project uses `48px` and `24px` respectively.)

        **Bonus**: Select a background image for your homepage.

        * Choose from the `images` folder or use your own.
        * Background images should be around `1000px` to `1400px` wide.

        The browser looks at HTML elements as a square/rectangular box.
        The CSS Box Model describes how the size of these blocks are determined using `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding` and `border`.

        #Page layout: Flexbox and Float

        There are a few different techniques for laying out content on a web page.

        We're going to use two different approaches: `flexbox` and `float`.

        * `flexbox` allows us to change the position and alignment of the containers on our page.
        * `float` allows our text and image content to share the space within their parent container.

        Then, back in `styles.css`, float the image using the class name as the selector.

        Lets try it out!

        #Floats and stacking flow

        So... the image and text are now displaying side by side, but there's one problem. The `blockquote` and `footer` content (inside the red box in the example below) have moved up beside our image.

        ![Project homepage with body content, block quote, and footer information placed alongside the main image. The block quote and footer content is wrapped with a red border.](framework/img/workshop/about-floated-notcleared.png)

        When an element is floated, *everything* after it will move into the available space. In this project, only the paragraphs need to float next to the image.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Clearing floats

        First, we used the `float` property to break the stacking order and force the block elements to line up side by side. Now we'll use the `clear` property to restore the stacking order.

        We have to decide *where* the page should go back to the normal. In this project, it's the `<blockquote>` element.

        #Class Exercise: Clearing floats

        Select the element to be cleared (where it should go back to a normal page flow) and apply the `clear` property.  The value `both` will clear either a `left` or `right` float.

        ```css
        blockquote {
          clear: both;
        }
        ```
        That will put it back to the regular stacking flow.

        ![Project homepage with body content placed alongside the main image. The block quote is below the main image, wrapped with a red border.](framework/img/workshop/about-floated-cleared.png)

        1. Add some `margin` to the right side of the profile image to put some space between the image and the paragraphs.

        1. Add some `padding` to the links in the navigation. <span class="note">(Hint! Use a *descendant* selector to apply the style to only the links in the `nav`.)</span>

        1. Adding some `padding` to the `blockquote` to improve the spacing and/or try adding `text-align: center;` and see if you like it.

        1. Change the `font-family` & `font-size` of just the paragraph in the `blockquote` to set it apart from the body text. The LLC project uses the Google font "Pacifico" with a `font-size` of `30px`.
        <span class="note">(Hint! Use a descendant selector to apply the style to the paragraph inside of the `blockquote`.)</span>

        Your page should now look similar to [`ex5-about-bonus.html`](project/examples/ex5-about-bonus.html) and `ex5-bonus.css` in the `examples` folder.

        The final design for the **Contact** page in today project is different from the other two pages so we'll need to create some special styles!

        Use the `class` attribute to apply these specific styles.

        In `contact.html`, we'll add a `class` to the `body` tag to override any styles, for any element, contained within the entire page.

        #Background Images


        So far, we've used `background` to add colours but it can also be used it to add images for presentation (as opposed to content).

        ```css
        background-image: url(path/to/file.jpg); /* longhand */
        background: url(path/to/file.jpg);/* shorthand */
        ```

        Since `styles.css` is *inside* of a `css` folder, include `../` to go *up and out* of the folder in the *relative* path to the image files.

        ```xml
        |-- project
          |-- css
            |-- styles.css
          |-- images
            |-- profile.jpg
            |-- background-1.jpg
            |-- background-2.jpg

        Background images **do not** appear in Internet Explorer when [Windows High Contrast](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/13862/windows-use-high-contrast-mode) mode is enabled! Use a foreground `img` tag for critical images.

        This can be changed with another background property, `background-repeat` or just add it to the shorthand `background` property.

        When using shorthand, be sure to include a space *between* values.

        #Class Exercise: Full background image

        Since this background image is applied to the `body`, let's add one more rule to ensure the styles added will cover the whole viewport.

        Let's add it to the very top of the CSS file, in the "global" section, to continue to keep the CSS organized.

        ```css
        html, body {
          height: 100%;
        }
        ```
        You won't notice a change just yet but this will be needed when we add the `background-position` property.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Background: background-position

        The `background-position` property is used to move a background image within its container.
        It has three different types of values: pixels, percentages or keywords.

        The default values of `0 0` place the background image at the *top left* of the container. If only one value is used, that value will be used for both the horizontal and vertical positioning.

        ```css
        /* shorthand */
        .contact {
          background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat 50%;
        }

        /* longhand */
        .contact {
          background-image: url(../images/background-6.jpg);
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-position: 50%;
        }
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Background: background-position

        This will align the background image to the middle of the containing element, horizontally and vertically.

        ![Project homepage, background image centered on the page with whitespace around the image.](framework/img/workshop/NEW_contact-no-content-bg-centered.png) <!-- .element: width="50%" -->

        But it still doesn't cover the entire viewport.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Background-Size

        `background-size` is used to change the size of the background image with CSS rather than editing the image file itself.  It can be added using the longhand style like this:

        ```css
        .contact {
          background-image: url(../images/background-6.jpg);
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-position: 50%;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```

        To include it using the shorthand property, there's a quirk. It _must_ be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character.
        ```css
        .contact {
          background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat 50% / cover;
        }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Background-Size

        If no background position value is included (which isn't required), `background-size` won’t work in the shorthand property.

        In this case, it may be less error prone to add just that property using the longhand property.

        ```css
        .contact {
          background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Class Exercise: Background Size

        Let's update the background image for the homepage using `cover`.

        ```css
        .contact {
          background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```
        There are other background size values besides `cover`. See below resources for extra info.

        For reference, you can also look at<!-- .element: class="note" --> `ex6-index.html` and `ex6.css` to review these background styles.

        #Crash Course: Forms

        When a website wants to capture user information (such as feedback, account details, contact info, etc.), it will typically use an HTML form.

        HTML forms have two components:

        - **The front-end**, (ie. the form itself, which is displayed to the user)
        - **The back-end** (ie. the script or application which receives and processes the contents of the form).

      <script type="text/template">
        #Crash Course: Forms (Continued)

        In terms of the front-end, HTML gives us access to a series of special tags which are used specifially for building forms, including:

        - `<form>` the form wrapper tag
        - `<input>` which accepts data from the user
        - `<label>` informs the user what the `input` is for
        - `<textarea>` a large, multi-line text box
        - `<select>` a drop-down style widget with options

        The back-end portion is typically written in an entirely different programming language (such as [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), or [PHP](https://php.net/)), which is outside the scope of this workshop.

        * *allow our visitors to contact us.*
        * *allow us to respond to our visitors.*

        Since we're interested in capturing user information, this sounds like a job for a form. However, since we can't create the back-end portion of our form, we'll use the [Google Forms](https://www.google.ca/forms/about/) service to build our contact form and to process the information that it captures.

        #Adding The Form

        We've created a public, shareable contact form, but it's hosted by Google.

        To embed the form on our *own* site, we're going to use the `<iframe />` tag, which allows us to display interactive resources that are hosted on other websites (eg. YouTube videos; Tweets; Instagram posts; etc.).

        Like the `<img />` tag, the `<iframe />` is self-closing and uses the `src` attribute to specify the location of the resource.

        We also need to add the `title` attribute in order to help describe the purpose of the `<iframe />` for assistive technology.

        ```xml
        <iframe src="path/to/external/resource" title="Description of external resource" />
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide side-by-side" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Class Exercise: Embedding The Form

        We'll start by adding the following snippet in between the `<header>` and `<footer>` tags of our `contact.html` file.

        ```html
        <main role="main">
          <h1>Let's meet for coffee!</h1>
          <p>Send me a message at <a href="mailto:hello@your-email.com">hello@your-email.com</a>, or use the form below.</p>

          <iframe src="" title="" />
        </main>
        ```

        Note that our `<iframe />` tag has empty `src` and `title` attributes. Don't worry, we'll fill these in shortly.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide side-by-side" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">

        Next, we'll navigate back to our contact form's "Preview" page, copy the URL from the browser address bar, and paste it into the `src` attribute of our `<iframe />`.

        Don't forget to write a short description of the `<iframe />` in the `title` attribute.

        Our `<iframe />` tag should now look like this:

        ```xml
        <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecBKTxLfdz5MAXaqINiTnFcOpXx-YmdRUdmDRKVcdb7OOReA/viewform" title="Contact form" />

        #Class Exercise: Embedding The Form

        We'll make a few additional updates before previewing our form:

        First, we'll add the `width="100%"` and `height="500px"` attributes to make sure the `<iframe />` takes up a certain amount of space on the page.

        Then we'll add the `frameborder="0"` attribute to remove the default border styles.

        When we're done, our `<iframe />` tag should look like this:

        ```xml
        <iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecBKTxLfdz5MAXaqINiTnFcOpXx-YmdRUdmDRKVcdb7OOReA/viewform" title="Contact form" />
        ```

        Congratulations, we now have a functioning, embedded contact form.

        Feel free to make additional changes to the form's styles or fields. Any changes made using the Google Forms tools will automatically be reflected in the embedded form.

        #More On Forms

        We used Google Forms to quickly create and embed a working contact form. However, if you peek under the hood, you'll notice that the form is made up of the same HTML tags that we mentioned earlier.

        We could probably run a whole course on forms alone! If you want to learn more about building HTML forms from scratch, check out the resources below.

        #Bonus Exercises

        Phew! We've covered A LOT of material today. But there's still a few more things you can add, to further customize your page.

        * Like the home page, add a [background image](slides.html#background) to the Contact page.
        * Add a [favicon](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-make-a-favicon).
        * Use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to add social icons to the footer.
        * The next slide contains instructions for adding special text styles.

        See the [final](project/final/index.html) version for some inspiration (included in **project > final**).

        #Extra Exercise - Special text styles

        Using `class`, create a special style to highlight blocks of text like this:

        ![](framework/img/workshop/highlighted-text.png)

        Create a `class` and name it something like `highlight`.
        Add a CSS property to it like `color`.

        ```css
        .highlight {
          color: #bf6d50;
        }
        ```
        Now, this class can be added to any element and it will apply this particular style.

        Use a `<span>` tag to wrap it around the text to apply the style to.

        ```html
        <h1><span class="highlight">Jane</span>Smith</h1>
        ```

        Add this anywhere you want some highlighted text!

        #Next Steps

        ##Getting your site online

        You will need to register a domain name and purchase hosting. Here are some suggestions:

        * [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - domains and hosting - use promo code **LLC40** to get $40 off your registration!
        * [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - free hosting for static sites
        * [Hover](http://hover.com/) - domains - save 10% with the promo code "learningcode"

        Why keep your domains and hosting separate?<!-- .element: class="note" --> [Learn more about Hover](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).

        You will also need to upload your files to your hosting server. You will need some info usually provided by your hosting service provider: FTP Address, Username, Password.

        Here's a tutorial getting your files online using FileZilla: [FileZilla Client Tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29)
